# How to collect data using the microbits:

# 2. flash reciever.py onto the microbit attached to the computer
# 3. open REPL and plotter on MU Editor
# 4. press reset on reciever microbit
# 5. press reset on logger microbit
# 6. the logger display will change to the heart after button a is pressed which means that 
#    it has started to take data, so let go of the pendulum
# 7. press button a once you are done with collection of data (a square should be displayed)
# 8. the data from the logger should be sent to the reciever and the graph can be shown on the plotter and data on the REPL
